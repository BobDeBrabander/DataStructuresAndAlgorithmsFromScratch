## Data structures and Algorithms from scratch

In this project I'll implement some data structures and algorithms from scratch for learning purposes.

The datastructures I will implement are:
- LinkedList
- Trees
- Tries
- General Graph
- Stack :heavy_check_mark:
- Queue / Dequeue
- Heap :heavy_check_mark:
- Vector / ArrayList :heavy_check_mark:
- HashTable

The algorithms I will implement are:
- Breadth-First Search
- Depth-First Search
- Binary Search
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
